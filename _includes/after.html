<h1><span class="header-inside"> Maintaining a project!</span></h1>

<p>
  We're looking for projects to help mentor developers as they get started with
  open source.
</p>

<p>
  What sort of tasks are a good fit?

<ul>
  <li>Tasks should take no longer than a few nights worth of work.</li>
  <!---
Specify how many days exactly.
-->

  <li>Tasks should stand alone - avoid tasks that depend on other tasks or *core functionality*.</li>
  <li>Tasks should be described well with tips to help the implementer.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  We suggest the label <code>up-for-grabs</code>,
  but using a different name is also acceptable.
</p>

<p>
  If this sounds like you, getting involved is simple:

<ol>
 <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-labels-for-issues-and-pull-requests/" title="Creating and editing labels for issues and pull requests">Label</a> bugs and feature requests that would be a good place to start</li>
 <li>Grab the URL to this list of tasks so that others can get to it easily</li>
 <li><a href="https://github.com/login">Sign in to GitHub</a> and <a href="https://github.com/up-for-grabs/up-for-grabs.net#list-your-project">check out the README.</a></li>
</ol>
</p>
